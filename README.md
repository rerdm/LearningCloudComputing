# Learning Cloud Computing üåê‚òÅÔ∏è

Welcome to my repository for learning Cloud Computing! Here I collect information, resources, and practical examples of the most important cloud technologies and concepts.

## What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud Computing refers to the delivery of IT resources (servers, storage, databases, networks, software) over the internet on demand. Instead of owning and managing physical hardware, companies can rent these resources from cloud providers and scale them as needed.

### Main Benefits of Cloud Computing:
- **Cost Efficiency**: Pay only for resources used
- **Scalability**: Automatic adaptation to changing requirements
- **Flexibility**: Rapid provisioning of new resources
- **Reliability**: High availability through redundant systems
- **Maintenance**: Cloud provider handles updates and maintenance

## Cloud Service Models

| Service Model | Description | Examples | Control |
|---|---|---|---|
| **IaaS** (Infrastructure as a Service) | Basic IT infrastructure: servers, storage, network | AWS EC2, Azure VMs, Google Compute Engine | High |
| **PaaS** (Platform as a Service) | Development platform with runtime, middleware, OS | AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Azure App Service, Google App Engine | Medium |
| **SaaS** (Software as a Service) | Complete applications over the internet | Gmail, Office 365, Salesforce, Dropbox | Low |

## Cloud Deployment Models

| Deployment Model | Description | Advantages | Disadvantages |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Public Cloud** | Resources available over public internet | Cost-efficient, scalable | Less control, security concerns |
| **Private Cloud** | Dedicated infrastructure for one organization | More control, higher security | Higher costs, less flexibility |
| **Hybrid Cloud** | Combination of public and private cloud | Flexibility, cost optimization | More complex management |
| **Multi-Cloud** | Using multiple cloud providers | Avoid vendor lock-in, best-of-breed | Increased complexity |

## Important Basic Terms in Cloud Computing and DevOps

| Term | Description |
|---|---|
| **Virtualization** | Technology for creating virtual versions of resources like servers or networks. |
| **API (Application Programming Interface)** | Interface for communication between software components. |
| **Load Balancer** | Distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers for performance improvement. |
| **Autoscaling** | Automatic adjustment of resource count based on demand. |
| **Microservices** | Architectural approach where applications consist of small, independent services. |
| **Continuous Integration (CI)** | Automated merging and testing of code changes. |
| **Continuous Deployment (CD)** | Automated deployment of tested code changes to production. |
| **CI/CD** | Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment: Automated software delivery ‚Äì e.g., GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, AWS CodePipeline. |
| **Immutable Infrastructure** | Infrastructure that is not changed after deployment but recreated when changes are needed. |
| **Serverless** | Code execution without server management, e.g., with AWS Lambda. |
| **FaaS** | Function as a Service: Serverless functions ‚Äì e.g., Azure Functions, AWS Lambda. |
| **Container** | Lightweight, portable software packages containing applications and their dependencies. |
| **Orchestration** | Automated management and coordination of containers and services. |
| **K8s** | Kubernetes: Container orchestration ‚Äì e.g., Azure AKS, AWS EKS. |
| **VM** | Virtual Machine: Virtual servers ‚Äì e.g., Azure VM, AWS EC2. |
| **VPC** | Virtual Private Cloud: Isolated network environment ‚Äì e.g., AWS VPC, Azure Virtual Network. |
| **S3** | Simple Storage Service: Object storage ‚Äì e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage. |
| **CDN** | Content Delivery Network: Fast content delivery ‚Äì e.g., Azure CDN, AWS CloudFront. |
| **Monitoring** | System monitoring to ensure availability and performance. |
| **Provisioning** | Deployment and configuration of IT resources. |
| **Rollback** | Undoing changes, e.g., for faulty deployments. |
| **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** | Management of infrastructure through machine-readable code. |
